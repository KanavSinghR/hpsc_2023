make -f Makefile_name      #to run makefile with different name from Makefile
make [target] -f Makefile_name    #to run target of makefile with different name other than Makefile

Let's sayy, in makefile if environment is not defined, say FC in Makefile4 was not defined:
1> It will return something default like f77 or f90
2>We can define it in shell   by:                export FC=gfortran      #environment can be anything
3>export FC will have priority over environment defined inside makefile (if ?= is used), like, FC ?= gfortran
